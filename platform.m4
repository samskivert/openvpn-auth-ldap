# OD_CONFIG_PLUGIN
#
#	Try to determine the proper flags to pass to the compiler
#	for building plugins.
#
# Arguments:
#	none
#
# Results:
#
#	Defines and substitutes the following vars:
#
#       MAKE_PLUGIN -   Command to execute to build a plugin
#       INSTALL_PLUGIN - Command to execute to install a plugin
#       PLUGIN_CFLAGS -  Flags to pass to cc when compiling the components
#                       of a plugin (may request position-independent
#                       code, among other things).
#       PLUGIN_LD -      Base command to use for combining object files
#                       into a plugin .
#       PLUGIN_LD_FLAGS -Flags to pass when building a plugin. This
#                       differes from the PLUGIN_CFLAGS as it is not used
#                       when building object files or executables.
#       PLUGIN_LD_LIBS - Dependent libraries for the linker to scan when
#                       creating plugins.  This symbol typically
#                       goes at the end of the "ld" commands that build
#                       plugins. The value of the symbol is
#                       "${LIBS}" if all of the dependent libraries should
#                       be specified when creating a plugin.  If
#                       dependent libraries should not be specified (as on
#                       SunOS 4.x, where they cause the link to fail, or in
#                       general if Tcl and Tk aren't themselves shared
#                       libraries), then this symbol has an empty string
#                       as its value.
#       PLUGIN_SUFFIX -  Suffix to use for the names of dynamically loadable
#                       extensions.  An empty string means we don't know how
#                       to use plugins on this platform.
